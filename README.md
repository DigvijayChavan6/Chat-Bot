# Chatbot Using NLP

This project involves the development of a simple console-based chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot processes user queries and provides relevant responses, tailored specifically for an e-commerce website dealing with vegetables and fruits.

## Features
- Processes user queries using NLP.
- Provides meaningful and efficient responses.
- Implements Python libraries like NLTK, PyTorch, and NumPy.
- Console-based interaction (no web deployment).

## Requirements
To run this chatbot, ensure you have the following:

### Hardware Requirements
- Processor: Intel Core i3 or above
- RAM: 4GB or more
- Storage: 10GB free space

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
  - NLTK
  - PyTorch
  - NumPy

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/DigvijayChavan6/Chat-Bot
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd chatbot
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure all dependencies are installed and configured correctly.

## Running the Chatbot
To use the chatbot, run the `chat.py` file:

```bash
python chat.py
```

## How It Works
- **Input Layer:** Captures user queries through the console.
- **Processing Layer:** Uses NLP techniques like tokenization and intent classification.
- **Output Layer:** Displays a relevant response based on the processed query.

## Snapshots
Below are some examples of the chatbot in action:

### Example Interaction 1
Mango: Hello! Type 'quit' to exit the chat. \n
You: show me fruits \n
Mango: Find all your kitchen staples under one roof! \n
You: do you have milk  \n
Mango: We have fresh vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes, onions, spinach, and more. \n
You: store hours \n
Mango: I do not understand. Can you please rephrase? \n
You: tell me about time \n
Mango: We sell snacks like chips, biscuits, and namkeen. \n
You: could you give me the open of store \n
Mango: You can shop anytime between 8 in the morning and 10 at night. \n
You: quit \n
Mango: Goodbye! \n

## Future Improvements
- Adding web deployment for enhanced accessibility.
- Integrating APIs for real-time data updates.
- Implementing advanced features like multi-turn conversations and contextual understanding.
